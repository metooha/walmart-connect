## Purpose
Link Button lets users take an **action** (button behavior) while using an **underlined/link-like appearance** (link styling). It is not for navigation.

## Rules
- **MUST** use the Living Design Link Button component.
- **MUST** use Link Button for **actions**, not navigation.
- **MUST** use a documented color variant only (do not restyle with custom CSS).
- **MUST** use a documented size only.
- **MUST** support focus-visible and disabled states (if the component supports disabled).
- **MUST NOT** use Link Button to navigate to another page/screen; use [Link](/components/link/) instead.
- **MUST NOT** underline inline body text using Link Button; use [Link](/components/link/) instead.
- **MUST NOT** jump to another element on the same screen using Link Button; use [Link](/components/link/) or an in-page anchor pattern instead.
- **MUST NOT** change the weight (typography) of a Link Button.
- **MUST NOT** change the color of any elements of a Link Button.

## Usage
Link Button is similar to a [Button](/components/button/) in that it allows users to take an action and make choices, but it has the appearance of a [Link](/components/link/).

- Link Button and [Button](/components/button/) are announced similarly by screen readers (button semantics).
- A [Link](/components/link/) is announced differently as a link and is expected to navigate.

## Variants
### Color
Use the default Link Button colors from the component API. If multiple Link Button color variants exist, choose from documented variants only.

### Size
Use documented Link Button sizes only. Prefer matching the size to surrounding UI (e.g., within toolbars, forms, or card actions) rather than inventing custom sizing.

## States
- Default
- Hover/active (web)
- Focus-visible
- Disabled (if supported)

## Accessibility
- Link Button **MUST** use `button` semantics (not `link` semantics).
- Ensure the accessible name matches the visible label.
- If using icon-only Link Buttons (if supported), **MUST** provide an accessible name (e.g., `aria-label`).
- Keyboard users **MUST** be able to reach Link Button and see a visible focus indicator.

## Token usage
- Prefer component defaults (Link Button should be token-wired for color, typography, spacing, and interaction states).
- Only use tokens for layout around the Link Button (spacing/gaps), not for restyling the Link Button itself.

## React usage (example)
Update import path after wiring in `guidelines/components/overview-components.md`.

```tsx
import { LinkButton } from "REPLACE_ME_COMPONENT_IMPORT_PATH";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <LinkButton onClick={() => {}}>View details</LinkButton>
      <LinkButton onClick={() => {}}>Reset filters</LinkButton>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Best practices
### Use when
- Use when adding interaction to key behaviors and features.
- Use when confirming or submitting information entered in a form.
- Use when canceling an action.
- Use when resetting a form or dataset.
- Use when closing a container or section.
- Use when opening a Popover.
- Use when moving forward or backward through a stepper workflow.
- Use when creating an object within a group.
- Use when applying a non-critical action to a dataset.

### Don’t use when
- Don’t use when you want to navigate to another page or screen. Consider using [Link](/components/link/) instead.
- Don’t use when underlining inline text. Consider using [Link](/components/link/) instead.
- Don’t use when jumping to another element on the same screen.

### Caution (native apps)
Consider using the secondary or tertiary [Button](/components/button/) in native mobile apps instead of Link Button. In web design, underlined appearances indicate a hyperlink that leads to another page and this is not a common practice for native apps.

## Content strategy
The text label should tell the user what action they're about to take.

- Don't use "Learn more" or "More details" which are vague.
- People mostly look at the first 2 words of a button, so it's important to start the copy with the most important words.

## Anatomy
1. Container
2. Leading icon (optional)
3. Text label
4. Trailing icon (optional)
