## Purpose
Text Fields collect single-line user input such as names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, and other short-form data. They are found within forms and can also be part of cards, search interfaces, or modals.

## Rules
- **MUST** use the Living Design Text Field component.
- **MUST** provide a visible label (or an accessible name when visually hidden).
- **MUST** support error/validation states using documented APIs.
- **MUST** support disabled and read-only states using documented APIs.
- **SHOULD** use helper text to provide supplemental instruction/context.
- **MUST** limit leading icons to 24x24px (medium sized) non-interactive icons only.
- **MUST NOT** show Text Field width larger than 700px on larger screens as it decreases legibility.

## States
- Default
- Focus-visible
- Disabled
- Read-only
- Error
- Magic (AI-filled)

## Sizes
Text Field supports multiple sizes to accommodate different layout needs and content density. Size names may differ in your API (e.g., small, medium, large or sm, md, lg).

## React usage (example)
Update import path after wiring in `guidelines/components/overview-components.md`.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { TextField } from "REPLACE_ME_COMPONENT_IMPORT_PATH";

export function TextFieldExamples() {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <>
      <TextField
        label="Email address"
        value={value}
        onValueChange={setValue}
        helperText="We'll never share your email with anyone."
        // Adapt prop names to your actual API:
        // size="sm" | "md" | "lg"
        // leadingIcon={<EmailIcon />} // 24x24, non-interactive
        // trailingContent={<Button variant="tertiary">Clear</Button>}
      />

      <TextField
        label="Phone number (required)"
        value={value}
        onValueChange={setValue}
        required
        helperText="Format: (123)456-7890"
      />

      <TextField
        label="Account number (read-only)"
        value="1234-5678-9012"
        readOnly
      />

      <TextField
        label="Unavailable field"
        value="This field is disabled"
        disabled
      />

      <TextField
        label="Username"
        value={value}
        onValueChange={setValue}
        // Error replaces helper text with guidance.
        errorMessage="Username must be at least 3 characters."
      />

      <TextField
        label="AI suggestion"
        value="AI generated content…"
        // Magic = AI-filled state; revert to default after user edits.
        state="magic"
        readOnly={false}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Usage
Text Fields are used for collecting single-line user input within forms. Inputs may include names, descriptions, emails, phone numbers, addresses, and other short-form data.

### Disabled
A disabled Text Field is unable to accept user input. It may require prior information or data to become enabled.

### Error
Error state displays when text input isn't accepted. Error messages replace helper text with additional instructions.

### Helper text
Helper text adds context to the Text Field's value and clarifies its use within a form.

### Leading icon
Leading icons should be used when emphasizing the type of field input. Examples of Text Fields that might include a leading icon include email, security, and calendar. The use of an icon will provide additional context to the field. Only 24x24px (medium sized) non-interactive icons can be used as a leading icon.

### Read-only
Read-only Text Fields display information that can't be modified. The content is not disabled so it can be selected and copied.

### Trailing
The trailing slot can be used to include suffix text, an icon or tertiary button.

### Magic
The Magic state is used when AI has automatically filled in the Text Field's content. It provides clear visual feedback to users that the content was AI-generated. Once a user modifies the Text Field's content, it should be reverted to the default state to indicate manual input.

The Magic state's colors will respond to the super agent theme of Sparky, Squiggly, Marty, or Wibey.

## Best practices
### Use when
- Use when a user must enter a phone number, name, email, address, or other single-line information.
- Use when gathering information that will help improve the user experience, such as zip code or credit card number.

### Don't use when
- Don't use when another form input component, such as [Select](/components/select/) or [Textarea](/components/textarea/), might be more appropriate.

### Do
- Do use a label for instructions critical to the Text Field.
- Do use helper text to provide additional information such as form-constraints or instructions. Be specific.

### Don't
- Don't replace the leading icon with non-icons, such as text or illustrations.

## Content strategy
The text label should clearly provide instruction for the field. Add additional copy above the Text Field if more context is needed.

If specific formatting is needed, use helper text to make that clear. For example, (123)456-7890 or MM/DD/YYYY.

When an error occurs, make sure the copy clearly explains what happened and how to fix or what to do next.

### Required fields
Provide clear and unambiguous labels for required fields that prevent users from making incomplete or incorrect form submissions.

- For forms with only one field (a password confirmation prompt, for instance), add the word "required" to the field label.
- For forms with two or more fields, add the text "* Required fields" above the form, and add an asterisk next to each required field's label.

## Anatomy
1. Text label
2. Value
3. Leading icon (optional)
4. Trailing (optional)
5. Container
6. Helper text (optional)

## Behavior
### Responsiveness
Don't show Text Field width larger than 700px on larger screens as it decreases legibility.

## Accessibility
- Label must be associated to the control (`label` + `id` or equivalent).
- Errors must be announced and associated (`aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`) when applicable.
- For read-only, ensure the field remains focusable/selectable (do not use `disabled` when the intent is "copyable but not editable").
- Required fields must be marked with `aria-required` or equivalent, in addition to visual indicators.
- Leading icons must be decorative only (`aria-hidden="true"`) since they are non-interactive.
- Keyboard users **MUST** be able to focus, type, and navigate between fields using standard Tab/Shift+Tab.

## Token usage
- Prefer component defaults (Text Field should be token-wired for color, typography, spacing, radius).
- Only use tokens for layout around the Text Field (spacing/gaps), not for restyling the Text Field.
